# FEED_THE_NEED

We, as a society, are more and more becoming cashless and dependent upon electronic transactions. A shortfall of this situation is that people in need are deprived; more frequently, people no longer have those couple of dollars or loose change in their purse or pocket to help them out. How can we address this while keeping it to a person-to-person basis instead of a blanket approach utilized by charities? Feed The Need. A web application that allows users to either sign-up for help or give support to those in need.
